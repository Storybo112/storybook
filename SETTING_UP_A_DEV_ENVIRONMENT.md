# Setting up a dev environment

So you want to set up a dev environment? AWESOME!!! This doc is here to help you get set up as quickly and painlessly as possible so you can start contributing to storybook.

## Prerequisites

Please have the latest versions of the following on your machine

-   node
-   npm
-   yarn
-   create-react-app
-   @storybook/cli

Yes, we are using `npm` not `yarn` but you still need the latest version of both as there is a bootstrap script that uses both

## Setting it up

### 1.  Setup storybook locally

If you run into trouble here, make sure your node, npm, and yarn are on the latest versions.

1.  `cd ~` (optional)
2.  `git clone https://github.com/storybooks/storybook.git` _bonus_: use your own fork for this step
3.  `cd storybook`
4.  `npm install`
5.  `npm run bootstrap`<sup>1</sup>
6.  At the prompt: `a`, `enter`, `y`, `enter`
7.  Have a beer üç∫
8.  `npm test`

<sup>1</sup>You can run `npm run bootstrap --core` - there will be no prompt and it will be WAY faster, but some tests will fail

### 2. Link storybook

Storybook is broken up into sub-projects that you can install as you need them. For this experiment we will be working with `@storybook/react`. 
**Note:** You need to `npm link` from inside the sub project you are working on **_NOT_** the storybook root directory

1.  `cd app/react`
2.  `npm link`

### 3. Create a demo project

1.  `cd ~` (optional)
2.  `create-react-app storybook-sandbox-app`
3.  `cd storybook-sandbox-app`
4.  `npm start`
5.  Verify that you have a working react app.

### 4. Setup storybook in your demo project

First we are going to install storyboook, then we are going to link `@storybook/react` into our project. This will replace `node_modules/@storybook/react` with a symlink to our local version of storybook. 

1.  `getstorybook`
2.  `npm run storybook`
3.  Verify that storybook works

### 5. Get them working together

1.  Go to your storybook _root_ directory 
2.  `npm run dev`
3.  Wait for the output to stop 
4.  Go to your storybook-sandbox-app directory
5.  `npm link @storybook/react`
6.  `npm run storybook`

## Hacking (optional)

You should now have a working storybook dev environment up and running. To verify this you can follow the following steps from your storybook root directory.

`open app/react/src/client/manager/preview.js`

Change the render method to return

```JSX
<div>
  <h1>Hello World üòé</h1>
  <iframe
    id="storybook-preview-iframe"
    title="preview"
    style={iframeStyle}
    src={this.props.url}
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>
```

Save and go to `http://localhost:9009` (or wherever storybook is running)

If you don't see the changes rerun `npm run storybook` in your sandbox app
