<h1>Contributing to Storybook</h1>

Please refer to our new contribution guide below. 

<h2>How to contribute</h2>

Storybook is a community-oriented open source project that welcomes contributions. Some of our most popular features started with a developer wanting to solve a problem for themselves.
