Here are some answers to frequently asked questions. If you have a question, you can ask it by opening an issue on the [Storybook Repository](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/).

### How can I run coverage tests with Create React App and leave out stories?

Create React App does not allow providing options to Jest in your `package.json`, however you can run `jest` with commandline arguments:

```sh
npm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='["src/**/*.{js,jsx}","!src/**/stories/*"]'
```

### I see `ReferenceError: React is not defined` when using storybooks with Next.js

Next automatically defines `React` for all of your files via a babel plugin. You must define `React` for JSX to work. You can solve this either by:

1. Adding `import React from 'react'` to your component files.
1. Adding a `.babelrc` that includes [`babel-plugin-react-require`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-require)
