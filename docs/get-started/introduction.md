**Storybook** is a tool for UI development. By isolating components, it speeds up and simplifies development. This enables you to focus and work on a single component at a time. You can create complete UIs without having to set up a complicated development environment, forcing specific data into your database, or navigating around your application.

Use Storybook to build small atomic components and complex pages in your web application. If it's a UI, you can build it with Storybook.

Storybook assists you in the **documentation** of components for reuse as well as the automated **visual testing** of components to avoid bugs. Extend Storybook's functionality with an ecosystem of **addons** that allow you to do things like fine-tune responsive layouts and test accessibility.

Storybook integrates with most popular JavaScript UI frameworks and (experimentally) supports server-rendered component frameworks such as [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
