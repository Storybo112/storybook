## Milestones

*Use this space to document how the project will be split up. At project kickoff, at minimum we should have all the milestones split up, and emphasize which is must-have and which is nice-to-have. As we dig in, flesh out the detailed implementational tasks in each milestone.* 

```[tasklist]
### Milestone 1: 
- [ ] task
```

```[tasklist]
### Milestone 2: 
- [ ] task
```

```[tasklist]
### Milestone n: be sure to always scope these in 👇
- [ ]  Metric collection
- [ ]  Documentation
- [ ]  Blog posts
```

**========= Everything below this line is strictly nice-to-have =========**

```[tasklist]
### Related issues that may be resolved by this project

## Decision Records

*Record here all the architectural decisions that we make along the way.*
